#### Chapter 23: Messaging

- **Situation:** Video Encoding

  - The API gateway uploads the video to a file store (e.g., S3).
  - It then writes a message to the channel, including a link to the uploaded
    file.
  - The API gateway responds to the client with a 202 Accepted status, signaling that the request has been accepted for processing but hasn’t completed yet.
  - Eventually, an instance of the encoding service will read the message from the channel and process the video.
  - Crucially, the request (message) is deleted from the channel only when it’s successfully processed. This ensures that if the encoding service fails mid-process, the message will eventually be picked up again and retried by another instance or the same instance after recovery.

- **Question:**
  - It says that the message will be picked up again for processing if the encoding service fails, But how does the message channel know that the request message is processed successfully or not?
